I have created a small website using HTML and tailwind CSS for an Online Bookstore platform which consists of 
1. HOME PAGE
2. LOGIN PAGE
3. CATOLOGUE PAGE: The catalogue page should contain the details of all the books available in the web site in a table.
4. REGISTRATIONÂ PAGE
   
Hope you would like it!
